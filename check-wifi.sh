# HOW TO INSTALL:
#
# 1) Install ifupdown and fping with the following command:
# sudo apt-get install ifupdown fping
#
# 2) Then install this script into a folder and add to your crontab -e this row:
# */5 * * * * /yourhome/yourname/network_check.sh
#
# Note:
# If you want to perform automatic repair fsck at reboot
# remember to uncomment fsck autorepair here: nano /etc/default/rcS

# Let's clear the screen

# This function will be called when network_check_tries is equal or greather than network_check_threshold

# we declare network as not working and we restart wlan0
